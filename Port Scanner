#Objective: Creating a port scanner that will attempt a TCP Connection from local HOSTNAME
#to every port to check of a port is open or not. For optimization we are using multithreads
#to asynchronously check more than 1 port per thread.

#ThreadPoolExecutor does asynchronous execution with threads.
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
#Socket library that will be used to attempt to form a TCP connection.
import socket
#To measure time it takes
import time
#To check pattern of IP address

#max amount of threads that will execute asynchronously
#depending on given workers, it changes time it takes of port scanner

#given the port range, it will divide the port range evenly into a list to be assigned to a worker
